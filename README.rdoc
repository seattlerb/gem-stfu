== DESCRIPTION:

A fork of gem-shut-the-fuck-up that provides configurable silencing of
post-install-messages.

== SYNOPSIS

Let's say you install a gem which has a post-install message that bugs
you:

    % gem install bundler
    Fetching: bundler-1.14.3.gem (100%)
    blah blah blah post-install guilt trip blah blah
    Successfully installed bundler-1.14.3
    1 gem installed

Now, all you have to do is add that gem name to the configuration:

    % echo bundler >> ~/.gem/stfu.rc

And your worries are no more:

    % gem install bundler
    Fetching: bundler-1.14.3.gem (100%)
    Successfully installed bundler-1.14.3
    1 gem installed

VoilÃ ! Guilt-trip free installs!

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Slightly better name, so you don't have to put it in your source.
* Easier sell on your boss than the original name.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* gem-shut-the-fuck-up, > 0

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install gem-stfu
